                career path...Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
                cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
                and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
                on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
                The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of
                Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
                interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
                Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
                original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
                translation by H. Rackham.
